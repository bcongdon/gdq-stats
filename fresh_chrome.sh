# fresh-chrome
#
# Use this script on OS X to launch a new instance of Google Chrome
# with its own empty cache, cookies, and user configuration.
#
# The first time you run this script, it will launch a new Google
# Chrome instance with a permanent user-data directory, which you can
# customize below. Perform any initial setup you want to keep on every
# new Chrome instance, such as adding bookmarks and extensions. Then
# quit this Chrome instance with Command-Q or by selecting "Quit" from
# the "Chrome" menu. (The red "close" button is not sufficient.)
#
# AFTER that, every time you run this script it will launch a new
# Google Chrome instance with a temporary user-data directory copied
# from the one you set up the first time you ran this script. Every
# new instance of Google Chrome launched by this script will be
# completely isolated from the others.



### Customize these

# Permanent directory to store the user-data directory of your 'fresh'
# Chrome configuration.
fresh_dir="$HOME/.fresh-chrome"

# Temporary directory in which to create new user-data directories for
# temporary Chrome instances.
tmp_dir="/tmp"
